#  PHYS 87: LaTeX Reports

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX reports for PHYS 87: Introdution to LaTeX with Professor Benjamin Grinstein at University of California San Diego. [Here is a link to the course information](https://courses.physics.ucsd.edu/2017/Spring/physics87/). There are 10 reports for the 10 weeks of the duration of the course, each of which contains a `.tex` file, a `.pdf` file, and other files.

Originally, I wrote these documents in TeXworks, but later switched to Visual Studio Code. I installed language support for LaTeX in Visual Studio Code. I also used `latexindex.pl` to format the code and the linter `ChkTeX`.
