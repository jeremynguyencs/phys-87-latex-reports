\begin{abstract}
	Hello, I am Jeremy, and \LaTeX is so cool. I actually really love this class,
	and I hope I end up learning a lot. It seems so useful and also fun. \LaTeX to
	me is a lot more intutive than typesetting on Microsoft Word or Google Docs,
	and also looks to be a lot more modular and customizable. I hope in my
	mathematics class and also in the future, I end up using this a lot more. Also,
	the documents \LaTeX produces are so beautiful.
