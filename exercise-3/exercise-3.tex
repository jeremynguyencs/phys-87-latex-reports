My first equation is $F=ma$. My second is

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Newton}
	F=ma
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{accel}
	a=F/m
\end{equation}

is the same as

The period is in the right place. I have palce it inside the displayed equation
(\ref{accel}). I want to write enough that there will be a few lines
after the displayed equation blah blah blah. I added equation
(\ref{eq:Newton}).

\section{Method}
\label{my-methods}

Here we discuss the methods

In Sec.~\ref{my-methods} it is shown how to bake a cake, for example.
