Here is some text. In table~\ref{dreamteam} we show our Dream Team.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. This is your world. That's a
crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Working it up and down, back and
forth. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. We're trying
to teach you a technique here and how to use it.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my
friends. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Absolutely no
pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little
imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You're the greatest thing that has
ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Tree trunks
grow however makes them happy. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him
reflections. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't
forget them.

\begin{table}[b]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c||l|p{1in}}
			Jersey & First Name & Last Name                            \\
			\hline\hline
			10     & Cristiano  & Ronaldo                              \\
			\cline{2-3}
			       & Edson      & Arantes\newline do Nascimento (Pele) \\
			\hline
			11     & Didier     & Drogba                               \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{ \label{dreamteam}
		This table shows blah blah}
\end{table}

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. It's so important to do
something every day that will make you happy. Let your heart be your guide.
Here's something that's fun.

Just let these leaves jump off the brush All you have to do is let your
imagination go wild. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. In
your world you have total and absolute power. Let your imagination be your
guide. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.

Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they
are to you. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Remember how free clouds
are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Poor old
tree.~\ref{dreamteam2}

We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Now, we're going to
fluff this cloud. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. The only thing worse
than yellow snow is green snow. Now then, let's play. You can't make a mistake.
Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out
of it. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. How to paint. That's easy.
What to paint. That's much harder.~\ref{dreamteam}

It's important to me that you're happy. We'll throw some happy little limbs on
this tree. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals.
That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. See. We take the corner
of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We need a shadow side and a
highlight side.

\begin{table}[b]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c||l|p{1in}}
			Jersey & First Name & Last Name                            \\
			\hline\hline
			10     & Cristiano  & Ronaldo                              \\
			\cline{2-3}
			       & Edson      & Arantes\newline do Nascimento (Pele) \\
			\hline
			11     & Didier     & Drogba                               \\

Let's make a happy little mountain now. You can bend rivers. But when I get
home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Play with the angles. We
spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Now we can begin working
on lots of happy little things.

In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.
Let all these things just sort of happen. Use your imagination, let it go. And
right there you got an almighty cloud. Let the paint
work.~\ref{dreamteam}

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Nature is so
fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Don't be bashful drop me a line.

This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. This is
probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this
with you. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your
mind first. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall
where it will. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Every time you practice, you
learn more. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends
with it. Anyone can paint. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.

Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.
Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We can
always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this.
